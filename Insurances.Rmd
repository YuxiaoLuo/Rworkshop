Size matters: insurance company A insures 100 cars, company B 400 cars. The probability of a car being stolen is 10%. Compute the probabilities that more than 15% of the respective fleets are stolen.

#### company A

```{r}
p=0.1
n=100
# less or equal than 15% 
pO = pbinom( floor(0.15*n),  n, p)
#1-pO

bp =barplot(dbinom(0:n,  n, p), col ="bisque", xlim= c(0,30), space=0);grid()
abline(v=n*0.15+1, col=2)
```

The probability that more than 15% of the company's A fleet is stolen would be: `r 1-pO`



#### company B

```{r}
p=0.1
n=400
# less or equal than 15% 
pO = pbinom( floor(0.15*n),  n, p)
#1-pO

bp =barplot(dbinom(0:n,  n, p), col ="bisque", xlim= c(0,), space=0);grid()
abline(v=n*0.15+1, col=2)
```


The probability that more than 15% of the company's B fleet is stolen would be: `r 1-pO`
