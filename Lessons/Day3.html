<p>we will fit a logistic regression model in order to predict Direction using Lag1 through Lag5 and Volume.</p>
<p>But we need to be careful: the <em>training error rate</em> is often overly optimistic-it tends to underestimate the test error rate. In order to better assess the accuracy of the logistic regression model in this setting, we can fit the model using part of the data, and then examine how well it predicts the held out data. This will yield a more realistic error rate, in the sense that in practice we will be interested in our model’s performance not on the data that we used to fit the model, but rather on days in the future for which the market’s movements are unknown.</p>
<p>To implement this strategy, we will first create a vector corresponding to the observations from 2001 through 2004. We will then use this vector to create a held out data set of observations from 2005.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>train=(Year&lt;2005)
Smarket.2005=Smarket[!train,]
dim(Smarket.2005)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 252   9</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>Direction.2005=Direction[!train]</code></pre>
<p>The object train is a vector of 1, 250 elements, corresponding to the observations in our data set. The elements of the vector that correspond to observations that occurred before 2005 are set to <code>TRUE</code>, whereas those that correspond to observations in 2005 are set to <code>FALSE</code>. The object train is a <strong>Boolean</strong> vector, since its elements are TRUE and <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
<p>We now fit a logistic regression model using only the subset of the observations that correspond to dates before 2005, using the subset argument. We then obtain predicted probabilities of the stock market going up for each of the days in our test set-that is, for the days in 2005.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>glm.fit=glm(Direction~Lag1+Lag2+Lag3+Lag4+Lag5+Volume,data=Smarket,family=binomial,subset=train)
glm.probs=predict(glm.fit,Smarket.2005,type=&quot;response&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Notice that we have trained and tested our model on two completely separate data sets: training was performed using only the dates before 2005, and testing was performed using only the dates in 2005. Finally, we compute the predictions for 2005 and compare them to the actual movements of the market over that time period.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>glm.pred=rep(&quot;Down&quot;,252)
glm.pred[glm.probs&gt;.5]=&quot;Up&quot;
table(glm.pred,Direction.2005)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##         Direction.2005
## glm.pred Down Up
##     Down   77 97
##     Up     34 44</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(glm.pred==Direction.2005)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.4801587</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(glm.pred!=Direction.2005)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.5198413</code></pre>
<p>The != notation means not equal to, and so the last command computes the test set error rate. The results are rather disappointing: the test error rate is 52 %, which is worse than random guessing! Of course this result is not all that surprising, given that one would not generally expect to be able to use previous days’ returns to predict future market performance. (After all, if it were possible to do so, then the authors of this book would be out striking it rich rather than writing a statistics textbook.)</p>
<p>We recall that the logistic regression model had very underwhelming pvalues associated with all of the predictors, and that the smallest p-value, though not very small, corresponded to Lag1. Perhaps by removing the variables that appear not to be helpful in predicting Direction, we can obtain a more effective model. After all, using predictors that have no relationship with the response tends to cause a deterioration in the test error rate (since such predictors cause an increase in variance without a corresponding decrease in bias), and so removing such predictors may in turn yield an improvement. Below we have refit the logistic regression using just <code>Lag1</code> and <code>Lag2</code>, which seemed to have the highest predictive power in the original logistic regression model.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>glm.fit=glm(Direction~Lag1+Lag2,data=Smarket,family=binomial,subset=train)
glm.probs=predict(glm.fit,Smarket.2005,type=&quot;response&quot;)
glm.pred=rep(&quot;Down&quot;,252)
glm.pred[glm.probs&gt;.5]=&quot;Up&quot;
table(glm.pred,Direction.2005)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##         Direction.2005
## glm.pred Down  Up
##     Down   35  35
##     Up     76 106</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>mean(glm.pred==Direction.2005)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.5595238</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>106/(106+76)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.5824176</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code>predict(glm.fit,newdata=data.frame(Lag1=c(1.2,1.5),Lag2=c(1.1,-0.8)),type=&quot;response&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##         1         2 
## 0.4791462 0.4960939</code></pre>
<p>Now the results appear to be a little better: 56% of the daily movements have been correctly predicted. It is worth noting that in this case, a much simpler strategy of predicting that the market will increase every day will also be correct 56% of the time! Hence, in terms of overall error rate, the logistic regression method is no better than the naive approach. However, the confusion matrix shows that on days when logistic regression predicts an increase in the market, it has a 58% accuracy rate. This suggests a possible trading strategy of buying on days when the model predicts an increasing market, and avoiding trades on days when a decrease is predicted. Of course one would need to investigate more carefully whether this small improvement was real or just due to random chance.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.0.2</span> Standard Errors incorrect</h3>
<p>The confidence interval for the slope does not contain zero, which would provide statistical evidence of an increasing trend in global temperatures if the autocorrelation in the residuals is negligible. However, the residual series is positively autocorrelated at shorter lags:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>acf(resid(fitAD),  main = &quot;Autocorrelation of residuals&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="Day3_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>, leading to an underestimate of the standard error and too narrow a confidence interval for the slope. Intuitively, the positive correlation between consecutive values reduces the effective record length because similar values will tend to occur together. The following section illustrates the reasoning behind this but may be omitted, without loss of continuity, by readers who do not require the mathematical details.</p>
<div id="generalised-least-squares" class="section level4">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">3.0.2.1</span> Generalised least squares</h4>
<p>For a positive serial correlation in the residual series, this implies that the standard errors of the estimated regression parameters are likely to be underestimated, and should therefore be corrected. A fitting procedure known as generalised least squares (GLS) can be used to provide better estimates of the standard errors of the regression parameters to account for the autocorrelation in the residual series. The procedure is essentially based on maximising the likelihood given the autocorrelation in the data and is implemented in R in the gls function (within the nlme library, which you will need to load).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.0.3</span> stochastic model</h3>
<p>The data exhibit an increasing trend after 1970, which may be due to the <em>greenhouse effect</em>. Sceptics may claim that the apparent increasing trend can be dismissed as a transient stochastic phenomenon. For their claim to be consistent with the time series data, it should be possible to model the trend without the use of deterministic functions. Consider the following AR model fitted to the mean annual temperature series:</p>

<p>Based on the output above a predicted mean annual temperature <span class="math inline">\(x_t\)</span> at time t is given by <span class="math display">\[
\hat{x}_t = -0.14 + 0.59(x_{t-2} + 0.14) + 0.013(x_{t-2} + 0.14) +0.11(x_{t-3} + 0.14) + 0.27(x_{t-4} + 0.14)
\]</span></p>
<p>The correlogram of the residuals has only one (marginally) significant value at lag 27, so the underlying residual series could be white noise. Thus the fitted AR(4) model provides a good fit to the data. As the AR model has no deterministic trend component, the trends in the data can be explained by serial correlation and random variation, implying that it is possible that these trends are stochastic (or could arise from a purely stochastic process). Again we emphasise that this does not imply that there is no underlying reason for the trends. If a valid scientific explanation is known, such as a link with the increased use of fossil fuels, then this information would clearly need to be included in any future forecasts of the series.</p>

<p>Now let <span class="math inline">\(x_t : t = 1, .., n\)</span> be a stationary time series with <span class="math inline">\(E(x_t) = \mu\)</span> and variance <span class="math inline">\(Var(x_t) =\sigma^2\)</span>, and autocorrelation function <span class="math inline">\(Cor(x_t, x_{t+k}) = \rho_k\)</span>. Then the variance of the sample mean is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Var(\bar{x}) =\frac{\sigma^2}{n}  \left(1 + 2 \sum_{k=1}^{n-1}{(1-k/n) \rho_k} \right)
\]</span></p>
